### What I learned

One of the many things I learned through this challenge was to apply shadow to an html element. At first, I thought it would be a simple process, who knew there are so many options to that, like spread radius, blur and so on. Additionally, getting that horizontal line was a challange as well because the horizontal rule is made out of 4 sides and to get to that level of thickness you have to remove the ones from the sides and either leave the one from the bottom or from the top.





### Useful resources
